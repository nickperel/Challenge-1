# Challenge 1: Horiseon Website

I was given a starter code for a website and tasked with improving the functionality of the website so that it meets accessibility standards and includes semantic elements within the HTML code. I also ensured that there was a clear structure to the code in the way it was formatted and made sure that all links worked properly. Alt attributes were also added to all images.
